        Hi, I'm Dan Crotty and welcome to my page! As a former college coach and
        3x All-American college player, I'm excited to offer private,
        individual, and small group lacrosse lessons for boys and girls players
        of all skill levels and ages in the Charlotte area. As a defenseman in
        field and a forward in box, I possess a deep understanding of what it
        takes to be elite on both sides of the ball. While coaching in college I
        oversaw both the face-off units and goalie units which allowed me to
        gain immense knowledge of the specialty positions and how to train them.
        My goal is to not just teach the "how", but also the "why". My depth of
        knowledge allows each lesson to be specifically catered to what areas
        the athlete needs to work on to reach their goals. If you have any
        questions or would be interested in scheduling a lesson, feel free to
        reach out via DM (@laxteacher), phone (123-456-789), or
        email(dcrotty4@gmail.com).
