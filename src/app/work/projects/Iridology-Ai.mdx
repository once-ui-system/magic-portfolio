## Key Features
- **Automated Iris Preprocessing & Feature Extraction**  
  Detects crypts, lacunae, pigmentation, and nerve rings using AI-enhanced segmentation.
- **Pattern Recognition with AI Neural Networks**  
  CNN-based models trained on curated iris datasets for precise analysis.
- **Real-Time Health Insights Dashboard**  
  Practitioner-friendly interface offering wellness reports & recommendations.
- **Cloud-Integrated Case Management System**  
  Enables easy history tracking, image comparisons, and client wellness mapping.
