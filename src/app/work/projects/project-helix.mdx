## Overview

As the **UX Team Lead** for Purchase team @ Coppel, I headed a multidisciplinary design team. Our primary goal was to redesign the critical **Cart and Checkout** stages, transforming a fragmented system into a unified and efficient experience.

## The Challenge: Metrics and Context (2H 2024)

At the start of the project, we faced a paradox in our performance indicators. Although brand perception was positive, transactional performance was lagging.

We identified the following quantitative pain points (Baseline):

- **Stagnant Conversion:** Despite stable experience metrics, web conversion was only **0.20%**.
- **Accessibility Gap (A11y):** There was a critical disparity; the App’s accessibility score dropped to **67%**, excluding a significant portion of our user base.
- **Untapped Potential:** With an **NPS of 84.7%**, we knew there was purchase intent, but the technical process was acting as a barrier.

## Implemented Solutions

### 1. Unified Shopping Cart

**Problem:** The inability to combine categories (Motorcycles, Clothing, Furniture) fragmented the user’s purchase intent.
**Solution:**

- **Unified Cart:** Developed a cart capable of processing multiple categories in a single transaction.
- **Item Persistence (Save for Later):** When a user pays for one group of products, the remaining items stay securely in the cart for future purchases.
- **Auto-Recovery:** A safety system that restores the cart after interruptions or connection errors.

### 2. Information Architecture and Content

**Problem:** Content lacked a logical structure for users with basic digital skills.

**Solution:**

- **Scannable UX Writing:** Concise text that reduces cognitive load and guides the user.
- **Conversational Tone:** Adopted an instructional and natural language style designed to educate users and bridge the digital literacy gap.

### 3. Coppel Credit Payment Optimization

**Problem:** Frequent bank rejection issues and excessive friction during the final steps.

**Solution:**

- **Logical Sequencing:** Restructured the flow so that previous choices naturally simplify the following steps.
- **Elimination of "Order Review":** The flow was reduced by **6 steps**. By removing the redundant final stage, we mitigated bank rejections caused by expired dynamic CVVs, directly impacting the conversion rate.

## Impact and Results

The redesign successfully aligned the shopping experience with our users' high loyalty (NPS), resulting in substantial improvements across all key KPIs.
