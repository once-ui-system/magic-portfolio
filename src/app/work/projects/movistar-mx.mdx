## Context

Movistar Mexico needed to evolve the experience of its digital channel to support a complex catalog of plans, devices, and promotions, while maintaining clarity for end users and consistency with the brand.

The main challenge was not only visual, but **structural**: reducing cognitive friction during plan exploration and enabling better decision-making in an environment traditionally overloaded with technical information.

## Problem

The eCommerce platform presented several friction points:

- Unclear visual hierarchy between plans, prices, and benefits.
- Information overload in key views.
- Inconsistencies across sections and navigation states.
- A purchase flow perceived as long and unpredictable.

These factors negatively impacted user trust and the efficiency of the conversion funnel.

## Design objectives

The project addressed the challenge of simplifying a complex, information-dense purchasing experience into one that was easier to understand, compare, and trust. Multiple plans, devices, and promotions competed for user attention, generating cognitive overload and uncertainty. The objective was to improve clarity and information hierarchy while optimizing the purchase flow, without sacrificing transparency or alignment with Movistar’s brand values.

## Role and responsabilities

My role covered the end-to-end design process. I conducted a heuristic evaluation to identify key friction points, redefined the information architecture to support clearer decision-making, and designed the core user flows and wireframes. These foundations were translated into a cohesive UI system and validated through interactive prototypes, working closely with development teams and stakeholders to ensure alignment and feasibility.

## Process

The solution prioritized value communication over technical complexity. Key benefits were surfaced early, plans were designed for easy visual comparison, and clear selection and progress states reduced uncertainty throughout the journey. The visual system balanced brand expression with usability, using color strategically and defining reusable, scalable components with well-defined interaction states.

Interactive prototyping was used to validate comprehension and hierarchy early, allowing risks to be identified before development. The outcome was a more predictable, confident, and scalable digital experience that improved decision-making and reduced friction across the purchase journey.

## Solution

The result was a clearer and more predictable experience, where:

- Users could compare plans more easily.
- The purchase flow felt shorter and more controlled.
- The interface communicated greater trust and structure.
- The visual system established a foundation for future iterations.

## Key learnings

- In telecommunications, **clarity outperforms persuasion**.
- Less visible information leads to better decisions.
- Visual consistency reduces cognitive friction.
- A good UI does not mask structural problems; it exposes and solves them.
