## Manage posts

You can create, edit and delete posts by adding, modifying or removing `*.mdx` files in the `src/app/blog/posts` directory.

## Frontmatter

The frontmatter is used to set the post's metadata: title, description, image, and tags. It's used in the post's page and in meta- and open graph tags.

<CodeBlock
    marginBottom="16"
    codeInstances={[
      {
        code:
`---
title: "Arriving to a new milestone in my career"
publishedAt: "2024-04-08"
image: "/images/gallery/img-02.jpg"
summary: "Every career is a journey, filled with challenges, growth, and those significant moments that mark a shift in our path."
tag: "Journal"
---`,
        language: "tsx",
        label: "src/app/blog/posts/post-1.mdx"
      }
    ]}
/>

## MDX syntax

You can use MDX to write the content of your posts. It helps you write rich and dynamic content with minimal code. Some MDX elements will be automatically transformed to Once UI components to integrate better in the design and add additional functionality.

## Custom components

You can use custom components in MDX files, but you need to import them first in the `src/components/mdx.tsx` file.

<CodeBlock
    marginBottom="16"
    highlight="11-12"
    codeInstances={[
      {
        code:
`const components = {
    p: createParagraph as any,
    h1: createHeading(1) as any,
    h2: createHeading(2) as any,
    h3: createHeading(3) as any,
    h4: createHeading(4) as any,
    h5: createHeading(5) as any,
    h6: createHeading(6) as any,
    img: createImage as any,
    a: CustomLink as any,
    Table,
    CodeBlock,
};`,
        language: "tsx",
        label: "src/components/mdx.tsx"
      }
    ]}
/>

As you can see, the `Table` and `CodeBlock` components are already imported and available for use. You can add more by simply importing them to this file and passing them to the `components` object.

## Hot reload

Hot reload of MDX files is currently not supported, but we're working on it.
