## üíº **ABOUT SECTION**

```
I'm a front-end developer and product designer who thrives at the intersection of user experience and technical implementation.

Currently leading growth initiatives at Reading Eggs (3P Learning), where I've driven measurable business impact through optimised user experiences and technical leadership.

In 2023, I founded AlmostHuman.digital to help early-stage SaaS founders plug user leaks and improve activation rates. Through rapid UX audits and technical implementation, I've helped clients achieve significant growth milestones.

When I'm not optimising conversion funnels or debugging React components, you'll find me exploring the latest in web performance optimisation or mentoring developers through General Assembly.

Based in Narooma, NSW, working remotely with teams worldwide.
